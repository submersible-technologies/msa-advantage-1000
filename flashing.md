ok so i have circuitpython on here instead of the default software because im a big dummy
so lets grab the [flash tool](https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/other-tools)
set it to the right com port, for me its com3, and... just wack the start button ig

that could be done, idk

setting arduinoide to com3 seems to cooperate
and yes! test code works fine
