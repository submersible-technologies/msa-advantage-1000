more to come, this is just my notes right now

done
==
- purchased MSA Advantage 1000 (used, ebay)
- purchased outsert for MSA Advantage (used, ebay)
  - make sure to order matching outsert size for your mask!! (check the markings at the top of the mask's visor
  - undyed is much cheaper premade ($20ish vs $60ish), but conceptually it's slightly cheaper to buy an undyed + fabric dye + a big pot from a thrift store (estimated $50). if shipping fees/tax kill it in your area, consider dying it yourself, but otherwise from an ecological perspective it probably makes more sense to buy the pre-dyed one
  - if you dye it yourself, make sure **you never use the pot in question for food afterwards**; fabric dye is not foodsafe and will likely leech into anything you cook in this pot afterwards
- [purchased one-way film](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07ZGCBZZT?psc=1)
- [purchased LED strip for mask](https://www.amazon.com/KWMSTPLT-Individually-Addressable-Programmable-Non-Waterproof/dp/B09P8MH56K)


plan of action
==
- one-way film along inside of visor outsert
- RGB strips along inside of visor outsert
- some kind of microcontroller (esp32?)
- microcontroller + battery on wristband
- wii nunchuck in hand, connected to microcontroller
- audio jack on microcontroller

todo
==
- buy a nosecup? will help much with fogging allegedly
- sd card for easy addition of hypnofiles
- we're gonna need to follow a collection of tutorials here
  - [RGB strip via ESP32](https://randomnerdtutorials.com/esp32-esp8266-rgb-led-strip-web-server/)
  - for hypnofiles, [part of this tutorial for ESP32 Audio player](https://esp32io.com/tutorials/esp32-audio), which should be most of it, but you'll have to figure *something* out for the volume
